I used postman todesign and automate the tests for the user section on https://petstore.swagger.io/ as the following 

1- Create collection (Testpro)>> see file Collection.json
2- Create requestes for users section 
3- create test cases for each request 
4- use postman runner to run the collection as workflow >> see file (Runner Test.json)  (Imag1+img2)for test result 
5- use the newman plugin to run collection via command line >> see file (newman.txt)
6- push project on git
